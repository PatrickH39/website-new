I'm Patrick Huynh, a civil engineering student at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca), where I was honored to be a [Schulich Leader Scholarship](https://schulichleaders.com/) recipient. My studies have given me a strong foundation in both technical and analytical skills, which I've been able to apply to various projects and roles.

I'm currently a Ground Station Hardware Developer for [UBC Orbit](https://www.ubcorbit.com/), where we're building a satellite named ALEASAT to assist with disaster relief by providing on-demand satellite imagery to amateur radio operators. My work in the COMMS subteam involves everything from designing power amplifiers to optimizing impedance matching.

I also currently work as a Service Desk Analyst for [AgeCare](https://www.agecare.ca), where I take on various projects under the Director of IT and the Manager of IT Support Services. My work here includes leading cybersecurity training initiatives, developing internal web applications for employees, and streamlining IT processes to save the company significant costs.

My passion for technology extends beyond my work and studies. I love building things that solve real-world problems. One of my current projects is an [ePaper Transit Board](https://github.com/PatrickH39/ePaper-Transit-Board) that shows real-time transit information.

I highly encourage you to check out the rest of the projects on my site!
